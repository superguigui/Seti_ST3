# SuperSeti

My own custom Seti UI. I arranged the colors to have lower contrasts and bluer highlights.

Original Atom's Seti_UI by [jesseweed](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui)

Sublime Text 3 port by [ctf0](https://github.com/ctf0/Seti_ST3)

I'm using a very slightly modified Twilight by Michael Sheets as a color Scheme.
